# FPL-net: A deep learning framework for solving the nonlinear Fokker–Planck–Landau collision operator for anisotropic temperature relaxation

# Installation
- You can install by
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HyungJunNoh/FPLnet.git
$ cd FPLnet
```

# Requirements
- Developed under Python 3.8.10, recommend Python 3.6.0 or above. 
- You can pip install by
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run
- You can run by
```
$ python run.py
```
This will make new file name result and you can get the result of Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6.
This code loads trained model and run the model with test datasets.
Then, run
```
$ python display.py
```
This displays two results in result file. You will get the result of Figure 7.
